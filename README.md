💡 **DESIGN CONCEPT**: This game is a tribute to [Gears of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gears_of_War "Gears of War"), the popular video game series well known for its emphasis on cover-based combat, in which players can use objects to avoid gunfire or safely engage enemies.

❗I have created this game using the [Supermedium aframe-super-shooter-kit](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-shooter-kit "Supermedium aframe-super-shooter-kit") as a starting point, plus [Kevin Ngo](https://github.com/ngokevin "Kevin Ngo")'s [aframe-look-at-component](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/look-at/ "aframe-look-at-component"), so thank you for your amazing work, [guys](https://github.com/supermedium "guys")!

⚠️ The challenge was to create firing enemies and health damage for the player, because at the time of this writing (October 2018) an entity cannot be both a target and a firing enemy at the same time.

❓*Why didn't I create just one version?*<br/>Long story short: I was lucky enough to manage to submit my game 10 minutes before the deadline!

❓*Why did you choose to sumbit the Gear VR version instead of the Desktop version? More people would have tried it!*<br/>"Gear of War" is a tribute to the mechanincs of "Gears of War", and its name makes so much sense as a game for Gear VR. What can I do, I like plays of words!
